      "step1": {
        "title": "1. Token Creation",
        "description": "When you launch a token on McFun, we deploy a new ERC-20 token contract with a fixed supply of 1,000,000 tokens. You choose the token name, symbol, and what percentage of the supply to allocate to the initial liquidity pool (minimum 50%)."
      },
      "step2": {
        "title": "2. Automatic Liquidity Pool",
        "description": "Immediately after token creation, an Automated Market Maker (AMM) liquidity pool is created. You deposit ETH (minimum 0.1 ETH) alongside your allocated tokens to form the initial liquidity. Trading is enabled instantly using the constant product formula (x * y = k), similar to Uniswap V2."
      },
      "step3": {
        "title": "3. Liquidity Burning",
        "description": "The liquidity pool tokens (LP tokens) that represent ownership of the pool are permanently burned by sending them to the zero address. This burns your deposited ETH and tokens in the pool forever, making your token unruggable - no one can ever remove the initial liquidity, not even you."
      },
      "step4": {
        "title": "4. Trading Begins",
        "description": "Your token is immediately tradable on our platform. Every swap incurs a 0.4% fee that goes to the platform to maintain and improve the service. The remaining tokens (not allocated to liquidity) are sent directly to your wallet."

        "description": "Unlike traditional DEXes that charge fees to liquidity providers (which can be removed), our 0.4% trading fee ensures platform sustainability without impacting the security of your token.
